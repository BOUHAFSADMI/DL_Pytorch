# Deep Learning with Pytorch

PyTorch is an open source Machine Learning library built by Facebook's AI Research based on Torch library, PyTorch is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.


## Contents:
